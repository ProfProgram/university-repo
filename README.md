## Short Description
This repository is, as the name implies, a logbook of sorts for my University work. Some may have been committed within other repositories as part of group work, but this is a complete collection.

## Tree Navigation Tips
### OOP Examples
These examples can be seen in the aptly named CS1OOP directories within Year 1/Teaching-period1 & 2, the former being less advanced than the latter.
Chronologically, I started with learning Processing IDE, a Java IDE geared toward visual outputs.
From that, I was taught Eclipse, including work using Java Scene Builder.
I did use Notepad++, but only for a single project, so my usage of it is not substantial.
./Year 1/Teaching-period2/CS1OOP is more straightforward with directories being numbered by week done. Additionally, this was done mostly in Eclipse.
### Modules CS2TP and CS2PLC
Module CS2TP was a coding group project that is already on GitHub.
The link there is here: <a name="CS2TP-link" href="https://github.com/ProfProgram/Gilded-Canvas">https://github.com/ProfProgram/Gilded-Canvas</a>
Module CS2PLC had a GitHub repository incorporated into assignments, thus it makes more sense to just redirect to here: <a name="CS2PLC-link" href="https://github.com/ProfProgram/PLC2025_210163492">https://github.com/ProfProgram/PLC2025_210163492</a>
