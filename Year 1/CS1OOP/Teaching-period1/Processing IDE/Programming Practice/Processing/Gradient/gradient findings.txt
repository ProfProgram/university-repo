1st loop findings;
	
	-	stroke(r,g,b); returns an rgb background() where variables = rgb values
	-	changing where the i is placed within stroke() controls the color of the gradient
		-	both colours of the gradient are related to the single set of rgb values (limits the colour 			combinations)
	-	original value of i will change y level of when the gradient starts, this does not squish the gradient 		it cuts off the colour that would've been there
	-	increasing the amount by which i is increased from i++ to a higher increment will increase the distance 		between each slice of gradient
		-	when increment is i++ then gradient is smooth since a new slice occurs every pixel along y-axis
	-	line(0, i, width, i); line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
this command creates the shape for the gradient.
x1 and y1 are the first point so (0 , i) is a point() that acts as a line() since i is variable: it makes the gradient fir the left hand side of the canvas due to x1 being 0
point(width, i) - potint1 was left-side so point2 is the right-side of the canvas.
changing line(0, i, width, i) to line(width, i, 0, i) does nothing to chnage gradiant
	-	chanaging myStrokeWeight value does nothing as far as I can see
